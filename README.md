With the dream of creating our own "Jarvis", `Capy` allows anyone to create and host their own virtual assistant (voice is the primary for sure. Tony Stark is too lazy to type) on their personal devices (PC, laptops, Android, iOS) with the minimum effort.

## Development plan

Below are features that `Capy` supports:
- [ ] Run the LLM inference on local devices.
- [ ] Wake-up command and name-awareness.
- [ ] Open other installed application (only-Linux support)
- [ ] Provide recipes to prepare training data for specific LLM models (both pre-training and alignment).
## Install
Update soon

## Demo
